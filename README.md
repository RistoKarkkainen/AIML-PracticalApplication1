This repository contains Jupyter analysis on topic "Will a customer accept the coupon?" <br>
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.<br><br>

##### I have the following findings for Bar coupon group: 
Overall, 41.19% (785 out of 1906) accepted the coupon.<br>
Drivers who go to bars more than 3 times a month seem to accept the coupon at a very high rate of 76.17%.<br>
Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are slightly older (25 years and older) accept the coupon easier at rate of 68.98%<br>
On the other hand, drivers that go to bars more than once a month and are younger than 30 years accept the coupon higher rate of 71.95%<br>
Also, drivers who go to bars more than once a month and who are driving with other people (not kids) tend to take the offer at a rate of 71.43%. Which is a high response rate.<br><br>
A negative note is that people that earn less and go to cheap restaurants do not accept the coupon. This could be because of the high price range. <br><br>

###### Recommendations:
Target low-income drivers with lower-end options. Target people who typically go to the bars as a priority. Even going to a bar a few times a month increases the potential significantly.<br><br>

##### I have the following findings for Coffee house coupon group: 
Overall, 49.57% (1888 out of 3809) accepted the coupon.<br>

Drivers who go to coffee shops more than once a month and are travelling with passengers seem to accept the coupon at a very high rate of 75.12%.<br>
Drivers who go to coffee shops more than once a month and are travelling alone seem to have a much lower response rate of 58.81%.<br>
Drivers who do not go to coffee shops often (once or less per month) have a very low response rate of 33.93%. <br><br>

###### Recommendations:
There is potential to attract drivers that are coffee shop visitors but are driving alone. <br>
Drivers who do not go to coffee shops often have a much lower response ratio, but they still respond. There could be ways to improve their rate. Maybe more targeted campaigns for those who do not visit coffee houses often.
